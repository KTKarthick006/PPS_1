20. Get a DOB from the user which is an 8 digit number. Check whether it is a Lucky 
number or not by following the steps below: 
Step-1: Calculate the sum of the digits in the odd-numbered positions (the first, third, fifth 
and seventh digits) and multiply this sum by 3. 
Step-2: Calculate the sum of the digits in the even-numbered positions (the second, fourth, 
sixth and eighth digits) and add this to the previous result (got in step 1). 
Given Date of Birth is declared as a lucky number, only if the last digit of the result from 
step 2 is 0. 
Develop a program to read the Date of Birth, if the number of digits is not 8 then print 
“Cannot be processed” and terminate program. If the number of digits is 8 and if the DOB 
is a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Lucky Number.” If the number of 
digits is 8 and if the DOB is not a lucky number, output the DOB with the message “Not a 
Lucky Number.” 
For example the DOB is 12032003, 
the result from step 1 is 9, 
the result from step 2 is 17 
The output is 12032003, “Not a Lucky Number” 
For example the DOB is 13101978, 
the result from step 1 is 30, 
the result from step 2 is 50,
